@barbieri1996 explores whether trade ties facilitate interstate peace. Her measure focuses on the interaction between salience and symmetry in the trade relationship.

Trade share:

$$
TS_{ij} = \frac{TotalTrade_{ij}}{TotalTrade_i}
$$

Where $i$ and $j$ are states.

Salience measures the importance of bilateral trade to state $i$:

$$
Salience_{ij} = \sqrt{TS_i*TS_j}
$$

Symmetry measures equality in the trade relationship:

$$
Symmetry_{ij} = 1 - | TS_i - TS_j|
$$

Interdependence:

$$
Interdependence_{ij} = Salience_{ij} * Symmetry_{ij}
$$

@chen2021 asks how trade with a potential target's allies impacts the likelihood of conflict. He finds that increasing trade with allies decreases the likelihood of conflict between $i$ and $j$. This is because this trade increases the cost of conflict.

$$
TD_{ia} = \frac{TotalTrade_{ia}}{GDP_{i}}
$$

Where $a$ is the target \$j\$'s allies and $i$ is the challenger.

@flores-mac√≠as2013 ask whether trade dependence prompts policy convergence. They look at the similarity in voting patterns between China (the influencer) and African and Latin American states.

They look at total trade flows and salience between states $i$ and $j$.

$$
TotalTrade_{ij} = ln(Imports_{ij} + Exports_{ij})
$$

They use @oneal1997's measure of salience:

$$
Salience_{ij} = \frac{Imports_{ij} + Exports_{ij}}{GDP_i}
$$

@gartzke2016 explore the relationship between trade and peace.

They take the natural log of @oneal1997's measure of trade dependence:

$$
Dependence_{i} = ln(\frac{Import_{ij}+Export_{ij}}{GDP_i})
$$

They use the lower of the two dependence values in a dyad to measure economic interdependence. They then use the absolute difference between these values for each state in the dyad to measure asymmetry.

They then construct three additional measures of dependence. First, they measure the ability of the state to avoid coercion by locating alternative trade partners.
